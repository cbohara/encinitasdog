											<h1>Hi Iâ€™m Charlie,<br />
											Your Local Dog<br />
											Walker &amp; Runner</h1>
											<p>Eager to keep your dogs happy &amp; healthy!</p>
										</header>
										<p>I have a lifetime experience caring for dogs of all ages and fitness levels.  I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Science and would welcome the opportunity to step away from a computer screen and get some fresh air with your dog!  I never never pack walk, so your pup will have my full attention. Whether your furry friend is enjoying their golden years and craving a gentle walk or an athletic energy ball needing a solid run or hike, I'm here to be of service.</p>

											<h3>Ranger</h3>
											<p>I've known Charlie since I was 8 years old, and I'm still going strong at 15!  The way Charlie and I play has evolved over the years.  When I was young Charlie and I would spend hours at the beach playing fetch.  I can still play ball, but Charlie is much more gentle with his throws and is mindful when it is time to call it a day.</p>
											<br />
											<p>We also have had lots of fun over the years going on hikes.  Charlie knows as a fellow in my golden years, I can be a bit slow along the trails and get thirsty easily.  Charlie is always patient and has water available so I can hydrate along the way.</p>

											<h3>Gretchen</h3>
											<p>I'm Ranger's sister, Gretchen.  I too have enjoyed many long afternoons at the beach with Charlie, although I'm more inclined to herd my brother than catch a ball.  I am 12 years old and have a collapsed lung, so Charlie takes extra good care to make sure I can keep up with him and Ranger on our adventures.</p>

											<h3>Maddie</h3>
											<p>Hi my name is Maddie!  I'm a sweet, 6 year old pitbull who loves to be outside and go on hikes.  I was a bit difficult to manage on a leash when Charlie and I first met, but he was patient yet firm with me.  Now it is easy for everyone to take me on adventures!  I love getting all my energy out hiking with Charlie so I can be super lazy the rest of the day.  And yes, this is how I usually look after one of our hikes.</p>

											<h3>Peter</h3>
											<p>My name is Peter and I am 5 years old.  I have spent a lot of time with Charlie because Charlie watches me when my dad Dan goes out of town. I am generally a mellow dog who loves to get in one walk a day.  If I don't get it, you can tell!  Charlie loves to go on walks too, so it is his pleasure to take me out so we can romp around the neighborhood together.</p>

											<h3>Lucy</h3>
											<p>Hi my name is Lucy!  I am spirited 2 year old shiba inu who loves to hike and run in the woods.  When Charlie was living in Oakland, he would take me out to the beautiful redwood forests.  I tend to get aggressive with other dogs, but Charlie keeps me in check.  I know he does this both for mine and the other dog's safety and wellbeing.  I appreciate that he does so I can continue to enjoy the great outdoors.</p>

											<h3>Des</h3>
											<p>When my dad Nels got a job that required a long commute, I needed someone to help take me out during the middle of the day.  Even though I am a hunting dog, I am known to be very sensitive.  Charlie was a great companion to me when I was struggling with the long days apart from Nels.  Charlie took me on long runs so I could be distracted by nature and get some fresh air to keep my spirits up.</p>
